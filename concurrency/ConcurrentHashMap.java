/**
 * A hash table supporting full concurrency of retrievals and
 * high expected concurrency for updates. This class obeys the
 * same functional specification as {@link java.util.Hashtable}, and
 * includes versions of methods corresponding to each method of
 * {@code Hashtable}. However, even though all operations are
 * thread-safe, retrieval operations do <em>not</em> entail locking,
 * and there is <em>not</em> any support for locking the entire table
 * in a way that prevents all access.  This class is fully
 * interoperable with {@code Hashtable} in programs that rely on its
 * thread safety but not on its synchronization details.
 * <p/>
 * <p>Retrieval operations (including {@code get}) generally do not
 * block, so may overlap with update operations (including {@code put}
 * and {@code remove}). Retrievals reflect the results of the most
 * recently <em>completed</em> update operations holding upon their
 * onset. (More formally, an update operation for a given key bears a
 * <em>happens-before</em> relation with any (non-null) retrieval for
 * that key reporting the updated value.)  For aggregate operations
 * such as {@code putAll} and {@code clear}, concurrent retrievals may
 * reflect insertion or removal of only some entries.  Similarly,
 * Iterators, Spliterators and Enumerations return elements reflecting the
 * state of the hash table at some point at or since the creation of the
 * iterator/enumeration.  They do <em>not</em> throw {@link
 * java.util.ConcurrentModificationException ConcurrentModificationException}.
 * However, iterators are designed to be used by only one thread at a time.
 * Bear in mind that the results of aggregate status methods including
 * {@code size}, {@code isEmpty}, and {@code containsValue} are typically
 * useful only when a map is not undergoing concurrent updates in other threads.
 * Otherwise the results of these methods reflect transient states
 * that may be adequate for monitoring or estimation purposes, but not
 * for program control.
 * <p/>
 * <p>The table is dynamically expanded when there are too many
 * collisions (i.e., keys that have distinct hash codes but fall into
 * the same slot modulo the table size), with the expected average
 * effect of maintaining roughly two bins per mapping (corresponding
 * to a 0.75 load factor threshold for resizing). There may be much
 * variance around this average as mappings are added and removed, but
 * overall, this maintains a commonly accepted time/space tradeoff for
 * hash tables.  However, resizing this or any other kind of hash
 * table may be a relatively slow operation. When possible, it is a
 * good idea to provide a size estimate as an optional {@code
 * initialCapacity} constructor argument. An additional optional
 * {@code loadFactor} constructor argument provides a further means of
 * customizing initial table capacity by specifying the table density
 * to be used in calculating the amount of space to allocate for the
 * given number of elements.  Also, for compatibility with previous
 * versions of this class, constructors may optionally specify an
 * expected {@code concurrencyLevel} as an additional hint for
 * internal sizing.  Note that using many keys with exactly the same
 * {@code hashCode()} is a sure way to slow down performance of any
 * hash table. To ameliorate impact, when keys are {@link Comparable},
 * this class may use comparison order among keys to help break ties.
 * <p/>
 * <p>A ConcurrentHashMap can be used as a scalable frequency map (a
 * form of histogram or multiset) by using {@link
 * java.util.concurrent.atomic.LongAdder} values and initializing via
 * {@link #computeIfAbsent computeIfAbsent}. For example, to add a count
 * to a {@code ConcurrentHashMap<String,LongAdder> freqs}, you can use
 * {@code freqs.computeIfAbsent(key, k -> new LongAdder()).increment();}
 * <p/>
 * <p>This class and its views and iterators implement all of the
 * <em>optional</em> methods of the {@link Map} and {@link Iterator}
 * interfaces.
 * <p/>
 * <p>Like {@link Hashtable} but unlike {@link HashMap}, this class
 * does <em>not</em> allow {@code null} to be used as a key or value.
 * <p/>
 * <p>ConcurrentHashMaps support a set of sequential and parallel bulk
 * operations that, unlike most Stream methods, are designed
 * to be safely, and often sensibly, applied even with maps that are
 * being concurrently updated by other threads; for example, when
 * computing a snapshot summary of the values in a shared registry.
 * There are three kinds of operation, each with four forms, accepting
 * functions with Keys, Values, Entries, and (Key, Value) arguments
 * and/or return values. Because the elements of a ConcurrentHashMap
 * are not ordered in any particular way, and may be processed in
 * different orders in different parallel executions, the correctness
 * of supplied functions should not depend on any ordering, or on any
 * other objects or values that may transiently change while
 * computation is in progress; and except for forEach actions, should
 * ideally be side-effect-free. Bulk operations on {@link java.util.Map.Entry}
 * objects do not support method {@code setValue}.
 * <p/>
 * <ul>
 * <li> forEach: Perform a given action on each element.
 * A variant form applies a given transformation on each element
 * before performing the action.</li>
 * <p/>
 * <li> search: Return the first available non-null result of
 * applying a given function on each element; skipping further
 * search when a result is found.</li>
 * <p/>
 * <li> reduce: Accumulate each element.  The supplied reduction
 * function cannot rely on ordering (more formally, it should be
 * both associative and commutative).  There are five variants:
 * <p/>
 * <ul>
 * <p/>
 * <li> Plain reductions. (There is not a form of this method for
 * (key, value) function arguments since there is no corresponding
 * return type.)</li>
 * <p/>
 * <li> Mapped reductions that accumulate the results of a given
 * function applied to each element.</li>
 * <p/>
 * <li> Reductions to scalar doubles, longs, and ints, using a
 * given basis value.</li>
 * <p/>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * <p>These bulk operations accept a {@code parallelismThreshold}
 * argument. Methods proceed sequentially if the current map size is
 * estimated to be less than the given threshold. Using a value of
 * {@code Long.MAX_VALUE} suppresses all parallelism.  Using a value
 * of {@code 1} results in maximal parallelism by partitioning into
 * enough subtasks to fully utilize the
 * ForkJoinPool#commonPool() that is used for all parallel
 * computations. Normally, you would initially choose one of these
 * extreme values, and then measure performance of using in-between
 * values that trade off overhead versus throughput.
 * <p/>
 * <p>The concurrency properties of bulk operations follow
 * from those of ConcurrentHashMap: Any non-null result returned
 * from {@code get(key)} and related access methods bears a
 * happens-before relation with the associated insertion or
 * update.  The result of any bulk operation reflects the
 * composition of these per-element relations (but is not
 * necessarily atomic with respect to the map as a whole unless it
 * is somehow known to be quiescent).  Conversely, because keys
 * and values in the map are never null, null serves as a reliable
 * atomic indicator of the current lack of any result.  To
 * maintain this property, null serves as an implicit basis for
 * all non-scalar reduction operations. For the double, long, and
 * int versions, the basis should be one that, when combined with
 * any other value, returns that other value (more formally, it
 * should be the identity element for the reduction). Most common
 * reductions have these properties; for example, computing a sum
 * with basis 0 or a minimum with basis MAX_VALUE.
 * <p/>
 * <p>Search and transformation functions provided as arguments
 * should similarly return null to indicate the lack of any result
 * (in which case it is not used). In the case of mapped
 * reductions, this also enables transformations to serve as
 * filters, returning null (or, in the case of primitive
 * specializations, the identity basis) if the element should not
 * be combined. You can create compound transformations and
 * filterings by composing them yourself under this "null means
 * there is nothing there now" rule before using them in search or
 * reduce operations.
 * <p/>
 * <p>Methods accepting and/or returning Entry arguments maintain
 * key-value associations. They may be useful for example when
 * finding the key for the greatest value. Note that "plain" Entry
 * arguments can be supplied using {@code new
 * AbstractMap.SimpleEntry(k,v)}.
 * <p/>
 * <p>Bulk operations may complete abruptly, throwing an
 * exception encountered in the application of a supplied
 * function. Bear in mind when handling such exceptions that other
 * concurrently executing functions could also have thrown
 * exceptions, or would have done so if the first exception had
 * not occurred.
 * <p/>
 * <p>Speedups for parallel compared to sequential forms are common
 * but not guaranteed.  Parallel operations involving brief functions
 * on small maps may execute more slowly than sequential forms if the
 * underlying work to parallelize the computation is more expensive
 * than the computation itself.  Similarly, parallelization may not
 * lead to much actual parallelism if all processors are busy
 * performing unrelated tasks.
 * <p/>
 * <p>All arguments to all task methods must be non-null.
